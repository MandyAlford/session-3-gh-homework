Some of my hobbies:


    1 running: I've run over 30 half marathons, a few full marathons, and one ultramarathon.
    2 camping: I go camping as often as I can. This summer I've camped in Salida twice, Telluride, Frisco/Lake Dillon, Grand Mesa, Palisade, Crested Butte, Moab, Lyons, Vedawoo, Gunnison, Buena Vista, and Conyers, GA.
    3 paddle boarding: I try and get out on as many lakes and rivers as possible in the short paddling season we have in Colorado.
