Travels:

    My favorite trip I've ever taken was in September of 2016- two friends and I went on a two week roadtrip to camp and trail run, with the main attraction being running the Grand Canyon from rim to rim (we did south to north) on September 11th of that year. It was the most amazing trip I've ever been on and I got to run in some truly beautiful places. We visited friends in multiple cities along the way and danced in the moonlight at every place we camped.
